You don''t have to see the target, but you must know that it''s within range. You can have more than one active contact at once, but you must establish contact with each target individually. Each contact lasts up to ten minutes. If you apply a level of Effort to increase the duration rather than affect the difficulty, the contact lasts for 28 hours. Action to establish contact'

        'You control the actions of another creature you touch. This effect lasts for ten minutes. The target must be level 2 or lower. Once you have established control, you maintain mental contact with the target and sense what it senses. You can allow it to act freely or override its control on a case-by-case basis. Instead of applying Effort to decrease the difficulty, you can apply Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus to control the mind of a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit), you must apply three levels of Effort. If you also have the Mind Control esotery, the normal level limit is 3 rather than 2. When the effect ends, the creature doesn''t remember being controlled or anything it did while under your command. Action to initiate.'

        'When you wish it, you can contact up to ten creatures known to you, no matter where they are. All targets must be willing and able to communicate. You automatically succeed at establishing a telepathic network; no roll is required. All creatures in the network are linked and can communicate telepatically with one another. They can also "overhear" anything said in the network if they wish. Activating this ability doesn''t require an action and doesn''t cost Intellect points; to you, it''s as easy as speaking out loud. The network lasts until you choose to end it. If you spend 5 Intellect points, you can contact twenty creatures at once, and for every 1 more Intellect point you spend above that, you can add ten more creatures to the network. These larger networks last for 10 minutes. Creating a network of twenty or more creatures does require an action to establish contact. Enabler'
